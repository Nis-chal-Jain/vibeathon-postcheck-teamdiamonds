# POSTCHECK: A  B2B platform that allows for easy management, tracking and reporting of issued cheques
---


## Background
Even in 2025, many businesses in India and worldwide rely on cheques as a means of transaction despite the existence and widespread adoption of digital transactions.
The primary reason being **Post Dated Cheques** provides trust and the legal obligation it imposes on the issuer, which ensures the billing cycle of the business.

Crores worth of cheque transactions are still done daily in India.  
Small and medium businesses (SMBs), schools, housing societies, and local traders issue and receive cheques constantly.

Yet — they still manage cheque reminders via:

- diary notes
    
- Excel sheets
    
- WhatsApp notes
    
- physical registers
    
- memory


However this gets complicated and hard to manage and are prone to errors. 

Hence many businesses tend towards industrial accounting software such as zoho workbooks , tally etc which introduces the problem of being too complex and require trained professionals.

Also comunication gap between the proprietor and accountant exist which can lead to default cheques.
